--Creating a element is a core thing of raect thats why we use react.createElement.

--It required three argument for creationn of raect element :-

-First one is tag name
-Second is a object where we can pass an attribute for example id, class etc.
-Third is Children

--Creating a root is a job of ReactDOM thats why we use ReactDOM.createRoot.

--When we use createElement it basically create a reactElement and this reactElement is nothing but a javascript object.

--Render method convert an object and put it on html.

--If we want to create a nasted structure using core react we need to put the childern inside the array.

--When we render something on root it will replace everything which is already inside the root.

--We can apply react in a smaller portion of our app also.
